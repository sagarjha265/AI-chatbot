Title: Chatbot Data and Model Repository

Description:

This repository contains the data and code used to train a simple chatbot model capable of classifying user inputs. The model utilizes a linear kernel Support Vector Machine (SVM) and is trained on a CSV dataset.

Data:

myfile.csv: This file contains the training data for the chatbot model. It should be in CSV format with two columns:
input: Textual input from the user.
label: Classification label for the input (e.g., greeting, question, command).
Code:

chatbot.py: This Python script implements the following steps:
Imports necessary libraries (pandas, sklearn, pickle).
Reads the CSV data using pandas.read_csv.
Prepares features and labels by extracting the input and label columns from the data.
Applies CountVectorizer from sklearn.feature_extraction.text to transform textual features into numerical vectors.
Trains a linear SVM classifier using sklearn.svm.SVC with a linear kernel.
Saves the trained model as pickle_model.pkl using pickle.
Loads the saved model for prediction using pickle.
Predicts labels for new user inputs.
Running the Script:

Clone this repository to your local machine.
Install the required libraries: pandas, scikit-learn, and pickle. You can use pip install pandas scikit-learn pickle.
Ensure you have the myfile.csv data file in the same directory as chatbot.py.
Run the script: python chatbot.py.
Example Usage:

Python
import pickle

with open("pickle_model.pkl", "rb") as file:
    model = pickle.load(file)

# Example input
text = ["Hello"]

# Predict label for the input
predicted_label = model.predict(vect.transform(text))

print(predicted_label)
Use code with caution.

Note:

The vect object (CountVectorizer instance) is not saved in the current code. You might need to consider saving it separately for future predictions without retraining the model entirely.
Additional Considerations:

This is a basic example. For production use, you would likely want to:
Clean and pre-process the data more rigorously.
Use a more sophisticated model architecture.
Implement error handling and logging.
Include a license file (e.g., MIT License) to clarify how others can use your code and data.
By following these guidelines, you can create a comprehensive and informative README.md file that effectively documents your chatbot data, code, and usage instructions on GitHub.
